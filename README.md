üìò README.md ‚Äì Tic Tac Toe Microservices Backend

üß† PROJECT DESCRIPTION
  This backend powers a real-time multiplayer Tic Tac Toe application with chat. It uses a Node.js microservices architecture to provide:
   - Authentication (JWT)
   - Room management (2-player logic)
   - Socket-based gameplay and messaging

COMPATIBILITY WITH:
   - üåê React web frontend
   - üíª Python desktop app
   - üì± React Native mobile app

üåê DEPLOYMENT NOTE
    - This README is focused on setting up and running the backend locally for development or testing purposes.
    - The production version of this backend is deployed on an AWS EC2 instance with Nginx acting as a reverse proxy and SSL termination layer.
    - If you're interested in deploying this to a cloud server or contributing to the hosted version, feel free to contact me.

  *üîê Important: Do not commit real secrets or database info. Use .env.example in your repo and .gitignore your real .env.

üõ¢POSTGRESQL DATABASE SETUP:

  - You will have to create your own databases. You can use tools like pgAdmin or the PostgreSQL CLI to set these up.
  - Two databases are needed:
    1. Authentication Database (persistent) = Stores user credentials (usernames and hashed passwords).
       CREATE DATABASE your_auth_database_name;

       CREATE TABLE your_auth_table_name (
        id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
        username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
        password TEXT NOT NULL
       );
       
    2. Room Management Database (temporary) = Tracks active game rooms and participating players.
       CREATE DATABASE your_room_database_name;

       CREATE TABLE your_room_table_name (
        id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
        username VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
        roomname VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
        service VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
        isfull BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
        slot_number INTEGER
       );

üì¶ SERVICES BREAKDOWN

  1. üõ°Ô∏è API Gateway
    - Unified entry point for frontend HTTP requests
    - Proxies requests to /api/auth and /api/room
    - Sends validated socket service URLs to frontend after joining a room
  
  2. üë§ Authentication Service
     Handles user registration, login, token issuance, authentication, and logout across all platforms.
   
  üîê REST API Endpoints:
    -> POST /signup
      - Params: mode = 'browser' | 'desktop' | 'mobile'
      - Body: { username, password }
      - Description: Registers a new user. The mode parameter helps determine where the JWT token should be stored (cookie for browser, in-memory for mobile, or secure storage for desktop).
    -> POST /login
      - Params: mode = 'browser' | 'desktop' | 'mobile'
      - Body: { username, password }
      - Description: Authenticates a user and issues a JWT token based on mode:
        > Browser: JWT is set as a HttpOnly cookie.
        > Mobile/Desktop: JWT is returned in response and stored in frontend app state or secure storage.
    -> GET /profile
      - Params: mode = 'browser' | 'desktop' | 'mobile'
      - Headers/Cookies: JWT passed via:
        > Cookie (browser mode)
        > Authorization header (mobile)
      - Description: 
        > Validates the JWT and returns the user's profile data on first render of frontend to bypass login, only used for mobile or webapp, not desktop.
        > > Authenticates the request. Failure of authentication likely from auth token expiration results in logout.
    -> POST /logout
      - Params: mode = 'browser' | 'desktop' | 'mobile' | 'socket'
      - Description: removes users auth token to ensure complete logout.
        > Browser: Clears the JWT cookie.
        > Mobile/Desktop: Frontend clears token from local/secure storage.
        > Socket: Used by the Game Service during disconnections to trigger cleanup (e.g., exit room, invalidate session).
        
  üóÑÔ∏è Storage:
    -> User data (username, hashed password) is stored in a PostgreSQL authentication database.
    -> Passwords are hashed using bcrypt for security.
    
  üîí Token Handling:
    -> A custom TokenMiddleware module handles JWT generation, validation, and route protection across HTTP and WebSocket layers.
  
 3. üß© Room Manager Service
    Manages game room lifecycle: joining, leaving, and tracking room status.

    üèó REST API Endpoints:
      -> POST /join
        - Params: mode = 'browser' | 'desktop' | 'mobile'
        - Headers/Cookies: JWT for auth (via cookie or Authorization header depending on mode)
        - Body: { roomname, username }
        - Description:
          > Authenticates the request. Failure of authentication likely from auth token expiration results in logout.
          > Registers the user in the room (creates it if it doesn‚Äôt exist).
          > Ensures max 2 players per room.
      -> POST /exit
        - Params: mode = 'browser' | 'desktop' | 'mobile'
        - Headers/Cookies: JWT for auth
        - Body: { roomname, username }
        - Description:
          > Authenticates the request. Failure of authentication likely from auth token expiration results in logout.
          > Removes the user from the room.
          > Deletes the room if no users are left.

  üìä Storage:
    -> Room state is stored in a PostgreSQL rooms database, used as a temporary session manager to coordinate room data for the Game and Chat microservices.

  üîÅ Coordination:
    -> After successful join, the API gateway shares the relevant socket service addresses with the frontend, which then directly connects to:
      - Chat Service (via WebSocket)
      - Game Service (via WebSocket)
  
  4. üéÆ Game Service
    - Socket.IO server
    - Handles:
      > Player X/O assignment
      > Turn syncing
      > Win/draw results
      > Rematches and exits
      > JWT handshake for auth
  
  5. üí¨ Chat Service
    - Socket.IO server
    - Handles:
     > Real-time messaging
     > Timestamps + usernames
     > JWT handshake for auth

üñºÔ∏è Architecture Diagram
Here‚Äôs how the services interact:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f676e8d-9a7a-445b-97a1-9c0a641a2547)                 
  
üîó INTER-SERVICE COMMUNICATION
  - Each service runs on a different port. The flow is:
    > Frontend hits api-gateway ‚Üí /api/auth or /api/room
    > If authenticated, room-service returns Chat/Game socket URLs
    > Frontend connects directly to chat-service and game-service via Socket.IO using JWT handshake
    > Room deletion removes all traces from memory

üß™ Running Locally

  1. Clone repo

      git clone https://github.com/MathKia/ttt_microservices_backend.git
      cd ttt_microservices_backend

  2. Install dependencies 

      npm install

  3. Configure Environment
     Create a .env file in the project root and populate it using the Environment Variables section above.
     Make sure your actual .env file is excluded from Git by having it listed in .gitignore.

 4. Start all services
  
  You can run each microservice in a separate terminal, or use a process manager like pm2 or concurrently. Make sure you are in the project's folder.

  Option A: Manually (Separate Terminals)
    node apiGatewayService.js
    node authService.js
    node roomManagerService.js
    node chatService.js
    node gameService.js

  Option B: Automatically with concurrently
    Install concurrently (if you haven't):
      npm install -g concurrently
   Then start all services:
      concurrently \
        "nodemon apiGatewayService.js" \
        "nodemon authService.js" \
        "nodemon roomManagerService.js" \
        "nodemon chatService.js" \
        "nodemon gameService.js"
      
  üí° nodemon will automatically restart services when file changes are detected. Install it globally with:
      npm install -g nodemon

üîê Security Notes
  - All services validate JWTs for protected actions
  - Only registered users can join games or chat
  - Database stores hashed credentials only ‚Äî no emails or PII
  - CORS policies configured to allow only trusted frontends
